# Team Profile Generator

## Desription
Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a basic software development team and generates an HTML page that displays summaries for each member. Before you can run this application the User must perform a npm install, so that the User is able to require all of the applications required dependencies.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video AND add it to the readme of your project.
